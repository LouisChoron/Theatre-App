# Theatre-App
This is a project I worked on, to improve the way theatre tickets are booked!

I enjoy going to the theatre and so book tickets relatively often. However, having to load the "seat map" to scroll through the availability for every seat,
for every single performance, takes far too long! Also, considering that the seat prices change per performance, it can be very difficult to find the best
time to go! This is even more frustrating if you're booking for a group, or don't mind when you go, and are looking for the cheapest seats!

I decided to write a program which, when given a number of seats and a date range; web-scrapes all the availability for the show "Wicked", finds the price of each seat,
sorts which are next to one another, and then produces the date/seats which are the cheapest! This was a difficult project for me, as I also used this project as a way to
learn about Pandas, and so was trying out data frames for the first time!

I then created a basic app that runs this code. I struggled to find a way to visualize the code's results, unfortunately, as the "seat maps" seen on most theatre 
websites are actually written with very difficult CSS code, making them almost impossible to replicate! The code still works, however, the project remains only
partly finished!

I hope to come back to this one day and include features such as "only search on weekends" or "include seat reviews, as well as price".

I hope this inspires someone to help fix the booking system! :)
